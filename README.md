Stationery eCommerce App
This project is an eCommerce web application for stationery items, built using ReactJS and CSS for the frontend. It is a single-page application that allows users to browse various sections of stationery products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. At checkout, a detailed invoice is generated, and users are provided with a (dummy) payment option.

Features
React Router: Implemented using react-router-dom for seamless navigation between different sections.
Product Sections: Users can select a section from the homepage and explore a variety of stationery items.
Data Management: Items are extracted from stored .json and .js files to display the available products in the eCommerce app.
Shopping Cart: Add, remove, or update the quantity of items in the cart.
Checkout and Invoice: Upon checkout, an invoice is generated with a summary of selected items, total cost, and a payment option (for demonstration purposes).
Print/Download Invoice: The final invoice can be printed or downloaded for the user's records.
